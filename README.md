# C#
A collection of the C# apps I've made. 

## UAC Control
A simple application that will tell the user if UAC is enabled or disabled in the registry. Also has two big buttons to enable or disable the feature, along with a restart button for conveince. 

The user will need to be an administrator to the desktop to make the appropriate change.
